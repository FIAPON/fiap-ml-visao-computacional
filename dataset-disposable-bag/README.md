# Garbage Bag Syntehtic Images

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/plastic-paper-garbage-bag-synthetic-images), originally created by Marionette.

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of deep learning classes with organized data.

This data set has 5000 images for each class: garbage, paper and plastic. Initially was annoted using COCO format. In this repository the images were converted to use YOLO model annotation.

This dataset was adapted to use in Machine Learning classes. The generated output image removed and the directory structure was changed.

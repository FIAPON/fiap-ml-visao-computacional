# FER 2013 Facial Expressions

This dataset was originally downloaded from Wolfram Research ( I. J. Goodfellow, D. Erhan, P. L. Carrier, A. Courville, M. Mirza, B. Hamner, W. Cukierski, Y. Tang, D. Thaler, D.-H. Lee, Y. Zhou, C. Ramaiah, F. Feng, R. Li, X. Wang, D. Athanasakis, J. Shawe-Taylor, M. Milakov, J. Park, R. Ionescu, M. Popescu, C. Grozea, J. Bergstra, J. Xie, L. Romaszko, B. Xu, Z. Chuang, and Y. Bengio. Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests. Neural Networks, 64:59--63, 2015. Special Issue on "Deep Learning of Representations") then organized into a unique folder ("dataset") with no separation of training and test. 

This dataset is intended to classify facial expressions from 35.685 examples of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. Images are categorized based on the emotion shown in the facial expressions (happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of deep learning classes with organized data.

Please, refer the full dataset at [FER-2013](https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/FER-2013).

This dataset was adapted to use in Machine Learning classes. The generated output image removed and the directory structure was changed.
